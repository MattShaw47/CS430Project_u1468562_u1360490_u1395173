IN ORDER OF COMPLETION PRIORITY

Testing:

Drawing Tests:
Drawing should change the state of the original page.
assertTrue(initializedPage != drawnPage)
Editing a pre-existing page should change the state of the save

Color/Brush Size/Shape Selection Tests:
Selecting a certain color should change the state of the pen
Changing the brush size should affect line thickness
Shape selection should allow for a new shape to be created.

Gallery tests:
The number of saved pages should equal the number of gallery pages.
Deleting a saved image should display one less saved image when opening the gallery.
Changing the state of a gallery image should update when viewing the gallery.

Save/Delete/Share Tests:
Adding N images should result in N saved images
Deleting all existing images should result in no images
Editing a pre-existing page and canceling rather than saving should not change the original page.
Sharing an image sends the correct image data to the receiver. (May be tricky to test via Unit Tests)
